**Course Name:** Programming with Large Language Models  
**Professor:** Prof. Dr. Andreas Maier
**Student:** Martin Reimer
**Project Title:** Development of Course Notification Service for FAU  
**Date:** 26.05.2023

Objective: The main goal of this project is to develop a web bot and an accompanying website aimed at improving the course registration experience for students at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU). A secondary goal is to document and reflect on the experience of using large language models, specifically ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, in the development process.

**Project Deliverables:**
1. A fully functional web bot that scrapes [www.studon.fau.de](http://www.studon.fau.de) for course listings for the upcoming semester and tracks the availability of the courses for registration.
2. A user-friendly website where students can register with their email and select their notification preferences.
3. Documentation including setup, usage, troubleshooting, and maintenance guides.
4. A short report on the experience of using large language models during development, including challenges faced, solutions found, overall benefits, and recommendations for future projects.
5. Presentation slides outlining the project's outcomes, and reflections on using large language models.

**Tech Stack:**
1. Programming Language: Python
2. Large Language Models: ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot
3. Web Scraping Framework: Selenium
4. Web Framework: Flask
5. Database: SQLite
6. Server: Cloud provider (optional)
7. Notifications: Email SMTP service

**Phases:**
1. **Requirements Gathering and Analysis:** Identify and document all the functional requirements of the bot and the website. Reflect on the assistance provided by large language models in understanding and defining these requirements. (1 week)
2. **Design:** Design the architecture of the bot and the website, establish the tech stack to be used. Reflect on the role of large language models in the design process. (1 week)
3. **Development:** Develop the bot and the website according to the established design and following best practices. Throughout this phase, document the experience of using large language models, noting any challenges and solutions. (3 weeks)
    - **Database Setup:** Set up the SQLite database to store course information and user preferences. Reflect on the role of large language models in setting up the database.
    - **Bot Development:** Write the Python Selenium bot to scrape course listings and their availability. Make the bot store this information in the database.
    - **Website Development:** Develop the website with Flask, allowing users to register and choose their preferences for course notifications.
    - **Notification Mechanism:** Develop an email notification system that checks the database for any course updates and sends notifications to users based on their preferences.
4. **Testing:** Conduct a thorough testing process to identify and fix any bugs and ensure the bot and the website function as per the requirements. Reflect on the role of large language models during testing and debugging. (1 week)
5. **Deployment (Optional):** Deploy the bot and the website on a cloud provider, configure them for regular operations, and ensure their stability. Reflect on the role of large language models during the deployment process. (1 week)
6. **Documentation:** Document the workings of the bot and the website, and provide guides for setup, usage, troubleshooting, and maintenance. Summarize experiences, challenges, and solutions related to using large language models during the project. (1 week)
7. **Presentation Preparation:** Prepare presentation slides that outline the project's processes, challenges, solutions, and outcomes, as well as reflections on using large language models. (1 week)
